### Design Patterns

After using design patterns in web application building, this semester I was able to gain a much better understanding especially of how developing in an open software environment is like. We were introduced to using many different design patterns Observer pattern being one of the main ones. To give my honest thoughts, I think that this is whats called giving pearls to a pig. In Japan this a popular saying which denotes that even if you give pearls to a pig, it will not understand its value. The model-view-controller is an innovative design pattern that capitalizes on the common issues that are faced when creating a user interface, splitting the task into three components greatly reducing the hassle for the developer. There must have been years of trail and error and improvements by many software engineers around the world that has lead to a refined design pattern like the MVC. In other words, we are years and years of experience away from understanding truly how design patterns make the work of a software engineer much simpler and organized. Now that we live in an age where having a smartphone is a requirement, I'm glad I was one of last generations that got to experience using not-so-smart phones. The first phone that I had was a casio flip phone and writing texts using a number pad was not so easy, I cannot imagine having to have to press a button three times to enter the letter "c". But all of this builds up for the moment I get my hands on a smartphone for the first time and experience how fast and easier everything is.

### Power of UI frameworks

As for the final WOD of this module, we created a clone of a webpage of our choice and honestly, I was amazed by how easy it was. Although I faced many small bumps and curves along the way, I was able to replicate a pixar webpage "fairly" accurately. I had a lot of fun looking into modern webpages and how they are made. 

After a good hour or two of work

I also do want to emphasize the fact that the replication consists only the very exterior portion of a website. Ofcourse it had no actually links that lead to another page on the site and were filled with small errors and unnecessary elements. I can't imagine the amount of work put in the actual pixar website and just from looking at the code in console mode, it looks extremely overwhelming. As of now I just want to be thankful for UI frameworks and the fact that things like this exist. It makes styling UI segments much less of a hassle and will become more of a greater tool once we learn to use it even better.
