### Getting to know Semantic UI         

Learning to use UI frameworks for the first time, there were many difficulties I faced this module. It was right after learning how to use html and css for the first time which was a hassle its self and combining the two was quite a difficult task. One thing that I learned the hard way is how different html and UI framworks is from coding languages that I have used. When using Java and C, the code either works or it doesn't. If not, I would look into the function or a section of the code that can be causing the error and narrow down the problem. However with UI frameworks, there were many occasions where I thought a certain class implementation would do something I wanted to but nothing happens. Because the code itself was fairly simple, I was stuck with an empty head staring at the three words of the class description that was somehow not working. 

### Power of UI frameworks

As for the final WOD of this module, we created a clone of a webpage of our choice and honestly, I was amazed by how easy it was. Although I faced many small bumps and curves along the way, I was able to replicate a pixar webpage "fairly" accurately. I had a lot of fun looking into modern webpages and how they are made.

 *The Cloned Version*

I also do want to emphasize the fact that the replication consists only the very exterior portion of a website. Ofcourse it had no actually links that lead to another page on the site and were filled with small errors and unnecessary elements. I can't imagine the amount of work put in the actual pixar website and just from looking at the code in console mode, it looks extremely overwhelming. As of now I just want to be thankful for UI frameworks and the fact that things like this exist. It makes styling UI segments much less of a hassle and will become more of a greater tool once we learn to use it even better.
