### Getting to know Semantic UI         

Learning to use UI frameworks for the first time, there were many difficulties I faced this module. It was right after learning how to use html and css for the first time which was a hassle its self and combining the two was quite a difficult task. One thing that I learned the hard way is how different html and UI framworks is from coding languages that I have used. When using Java and C, the code either works or it doesn't. If not, I would look into the function or a section of the code that can be causing the error and narrow down the problem. However with UI frameworks, there were many occasions where I thought a certain class implementation would do something I wanted to but nothing happens. Because the code itself was fairly simple, I was stuck with an empty head staring at the three words of the class description that was somehow not working. 

### What is my Rad Grad?

As a third year Computer Science student, I currently have no plans on going into a job relating to software development neither computers pretty much. Looking back at my high school years and my first year at UH, I probably had no idea what I was doing. I chose my previous major without having any real thought behind it thinking it would somehow work out. I ended up changing majors at the end of the first year because I knew that it's better to be early with this kind of decision. Speaking as of now I'm glad I made the decision I made and despite I had an knew that the skills I develop as I proceed my new studies as a Comp Sci student might not directly be useful for my future job, It definitely will become a speciality when going into the work force.

One feature of Rad Grad that I thought was compelling was the statistical representation of the student experience in three categories Innovation, Competency, and Experience. In the course plan, we added some opportunities found in the list provided by Rad Grad and each of them consists of points for one or more categories based on the properties of that certain experience. Even if I don't end up using Rad Grad in the future, having a balanced experience as a undergraduate is a plus for any path I end up taking.
