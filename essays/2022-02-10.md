### Previous experiences with coding standards

I have some prior experience with coding standards from my previous ISC courses. In my ICS 212 course that I took last semester, we had semi strict coding styles that required us to add four spaces to indent code and to never use the tab key for it. We also had to add comment boxes above every source file and above each of the function it had containing things like the funciton name, parameters, and return values. 

### This is subtitle 2

Looking deeper into smart and not so smart questions. I found examples of both of them in stackOverflow to use as references to make distinctions between the two. The first being an example of a not so smart question which can be accessed from here [Why first CSS variable resets when I change second?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65162567/why-first-css-variable-resets-when-i-change-second-custom-color-theme). The user was writing code to set custom colors for a site and wanted to know why one of the color values gets changed as the second one is changed. The biggest issue with this post was the overall lack of information describing the problem the user is facing. The post consists of just a few sentences and has a copy of the source code and makes an impression that the user is being lazy. Another issue is that the user is looking for answers to why the certain method does not work when there could be better and simpler ways to achieve the same thing. The post ends with an answer that kindly suggests to use a different method that seemed to have worked.

### After using eslint for a week

On to the smart question, the post can be accessed from here [Deep copy an array in Angular 2 + TypeScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35504310/deep-copy-an-array-in-angular-2-typescript?noredirect=1&lq=1). This user is looking for a way to duplicate an input of arrays containing objects and change one property of it. The reason this is a smart question is because despite the question being fairly simple, the user managed to be short but precise not wasting the readers time and attention. The user shared source codes of the two methods that did not work when trying by themselves, indicating that the user has done some research and spent some time beforehand. The readers then were able to provide the user with a simple line of code that solved the issue.
