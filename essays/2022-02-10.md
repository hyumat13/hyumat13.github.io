### Previous experiences with coding standards

I have some prior experience with coding standards from my previous ISC courses. In my ICS 212 course that I took last semester, we had semi strict coding styles that required us to add four spaces to indent code and to never use the tab key for it. We also had to add comment boxes above every source file and above each of the function it had containing things like the funciton name, parameters, and return values. This was quite a pain to follow since the main software that we were using was pretty old. Most things were done manually, no help was given by the editor to check for style and even syntactic errors. 

### Coding standards rock

Even before going into this module, I was all about learning coding standards and improving it. I totally agree that this is a technique that a software engineer should learn to improve the quality of their code. Unless I'm planning on writing code just for myself, there is no reason not to follow a certain style. It would make collaborating with other programmers alot easier since there will be less stress trying to understand code that someone else wrote. Having said what I said, even if writing code just for myself, it would be beneficial for me to have coding standards with things like catching errors and preventing error in the first place. 

### After using eslint for a week

On to the smart question, the post can be accessed from here [Deep copy an array in Angular 2 + TypeScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35504310/deep-copy-an-array-in-angular-2-typescript?noredirect=1&lq=1). This user is looking for a way to duplicate an input of arrays containing objects and change one property of it. The reason this is a smart question is because despite the question being fairly simple, the user managed to be short but precise not wasting the readers time and attention. The user shared source codes of the two methods that did not work when trying by themselves, indicating that the user has done some research and spent some time beforehand. The readers then were able to provide the user with a simple line of code that solved the issue.
